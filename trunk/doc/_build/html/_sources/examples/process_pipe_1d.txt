process example: process_pipe_1d
================================

This example shows how nmrglue can be used to process NMR data.  In this 
script a 1D time domain NMRPipe file is processing into a 1D NMRPipe 
frequency domain file.  After processing the resulting file is compared to
one processed with NMRPipe.
